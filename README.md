# Refactoring Project

This project demonstrates how to refactor a script by moving processing logic into reusable functions within a `utils.py` module.

## Structure

- `main.py`: Main script with only function calls.
- `utils.py`: Contains all reusable functions.
- `data/`: Directory to store input data.
- `output/`: Directory for saving outputs.
